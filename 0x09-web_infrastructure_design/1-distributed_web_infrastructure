Addition of Additional Elements:

We're adding more servers, load balancers, and database nodes to make our system stronger and handle more users without crashing.
Each new piece we add boosts our system's power and makes it less likely to break if something goes wrong.
Distribution Algorithm of Load Balancer:

The load balancer spreads out the work evenly across all our servers.
This helps make sure no single server gets too busy, keeping our system running smoothly.
Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:

Our servers are set up to all work at the same time, which is called an Active-Active setup.
This means they're all pitching in to help out, so if one server goes down, the others can keep things going.
Primary-Replica Database Cluster:

Our database is set up with one main server that handles writing data and several backup servers that help out with reading data.
This keeps our data safe and makes it faster for users to access.
Difference Between Primary and Replica Nodes:

The main server handles writing data, while the backup servers help out by reading data.
This setup keeps our system running smoothly and ensures we can handle lots of users at once.
Issues with the Infrastructure:

Our system has some weak spots, like not having enough backup servers and lacking security measures.
This could make it easier for bad actors to cause problems or for our system to break down unexpectedly.
Without good monitoring, we might not even notice there's a problem until it's too late.
