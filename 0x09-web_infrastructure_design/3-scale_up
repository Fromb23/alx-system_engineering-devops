Why Additional Elements are Added:
	We add more servers and load balancers to make our system faster and more reliable.

Firewalls:
	Firewalls keep bad guys out of our system by watching the traffic coming in and going out.

HTTPS for Traffic:
	HTTPS keeps our users' data safe by scrambling it as it travels between their devices and our servers.

Monitoring:
	Monitoring tools keep an eye on our system's health and performance in real-time.

Data Collection by Monitoring Tools:
	Monitoring tools gather information about our system by checking things like how busy our servers are and how much data is flowing through them.

Monitoring Web Server QPS:
	We use monitoring tools to see how many requests our web server gets each second.

Issues with the Infrastructure:
	Putting too much work on our load balancers by decrypting all our traffic can slow things down.
	Relying on just one MySQL server for writes is risky because if it goes down, we could lose important data.
	Having identical servers might make our system vulnerable if something goes wrong with one component, it could affect all the servers.
